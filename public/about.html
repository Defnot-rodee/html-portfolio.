<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi! I'm Rodiyyah by name. A student of the University Of Ilorin, popularly known as Unilorin. I'm a Mathematics Major(final year). 
  I was born on the 23rd of April, 2004 at Ibadan in Oyo State. I'm also the last child of my parents...with two elder sisters
  As the name implies I'm a Muslim. A Nigerian to be precise.</p>

<p>I'm dark in complexion. I have 2 close friends and their names are Hikmah and Fadilah. I've been friends with them since our 100level
  and I really love them. They are also the last child of their parents. Hikmah has 2 elder brothers while Fadilah has  2 elder sisters and a brother.
  Right now, we are on a litlle break and I haven't seen them in a week. Hikmah has a business she's into.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm learning web development. I have started since last year and haven't really been into it that much but I really want to 
 take it serious now. I'm almost done with uni and soon be in the outside world. I'm an introvert with no skill which can be quite dangerous.
 She's trying to develop a skill.</p>
